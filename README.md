# TRICOLORS

TRICOLORS is a tiny puzzle game inspired by [*Lights Out*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)), participating [GitHub Game Off 2017](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017).

## Introduction

Try removing all colored blocks in a 5x5 map. Solve endless puzzles with increasing difficulties!

This game is inspired by a game *Lights Out* in my childhood memories. Original *Lights Out* game is designed for monocolor screens. I made it much more difficult by coloring the blocks. Each block can be colored red / green / blue, and these 3 colors can be mixed together:

* red + green = yellow
* red + blue = purple
* green + blue = cyan
* red + green + blue = white
